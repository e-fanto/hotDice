Feeling Lucky??

#This app 
is a simple dice randomizer with some CLI ASCII illustratrations and delays. 
The user chooses how many dice they would like to roll and the results appear on the CLI. 
I am working to implement the ability to hold certain dice and re-roll. I want the user to
also be able to decide how many dice they would like to roll for the duration of the app in
case they are trying to play a game like Yahtzee. 

Another wip of mine is Fake Yahtzee using Vue. I want that to implement an interactive scorecard 
with the game logic built in. It's pretty sloppy right now, but there is a readme.md if you 
wanted to see what I'm planning.
